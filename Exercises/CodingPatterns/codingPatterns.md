Common coding challenge patterns are specific problem-solving approaches that are frequently encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming. These patterns help in recognizing and efficiently solving various types of problems. Some common coding challenge patterns include:

1. **Two Pointers**: Utilized in problems that involve finding pairs of elements that meet certain criteria, often by iterating through the array with two pointers simultaneously.
2. **Sliding Window**: Used for solving problems that require finding a substring or subarray that meets specific conditions by maintaining a dynamic window.
3. **Binary Search**: Applied to problems that involve searching for an element in a sorted array or finding an optimal solution by iteratively dividing the search space in half.
4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Employed in problems involving graph traversal or finding paths in a graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Utilized in graph traversal problems by exploring all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes.
6. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and caching the results to avoid redundant computations.
7. **Greedy Algorithms**: Applied to optimization problems where making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.
8. **Backtracking**: Employed in problems that involve generating all possible solutions or permutations by systematically exploring all potential candidates.
9. **Hashing**: Utilized for problems involving data lookup, frequency counting, or identifying duplicate elements by storing elements in a hash table.
10. **Topological Sorting**: Used to solve problems involving directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) by ordering the vertices such that for every directed edge `uv` from vertex `u` to vertex `v`, `u` comes before `v` in the ordering.

These patterns are essential tools for solving coding challenges efficiently. Familiarizing yourself with these patterns and practicing their implementation can greatly improve your problem-solving skills and performance in coding interviews and competitions.
