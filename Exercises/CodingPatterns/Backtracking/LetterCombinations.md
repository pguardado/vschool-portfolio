## Problem Summary

The problem is to generate all possible letter combinations that a given string of digits (from 2 to 9) could represent, based on the mapping of digits to letters on a traditional telephone keypad. Each digit maps to a set of letters:

- 2: "abc"
- 3: "def"
- 4: "ghi"
- 5: "jkl"
- 6: "mno"
- 7: "pqrs"
- 8: "tuv"
- 9: "wxyz"

## Logic to Solve

The solution involves generating combinations by mapping each digit to its corresponding letters and then using a recursive approach to build all possible combinations. We use backtracking to explore all possible letter combinations for each digit in the input string.

## Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**:
   - Create a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters.
2. **Initialization**:
   - If the input string is empty, return an empty list.
   - Start with an empty string to build combinations.
3. **Recursion/Base Case**:
   - Use a recursive function to build the combinations.
   - For each digit in the input string, append each corresponding letter to the current combination and recursively call the function with the next digit.
   - When the length of the current combination equals the length of the input digits, add the combination to the results list.
4. **Backtracking**:
   - After exploring a combination, backtrack by removing the last added letter and explore the next possibility.

## Pseudocode

```
function letterCombinations(digits):
    if digits is empty:
        return []

    digitToLetters = {
        "2": "abc", "3": "def", "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl",
        "6": "mno", "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"
    }
    results = []

    function backtrack(index, currentCombination):
        if index == length of digits:
            results.append(currentCombination)
            return

        currentDigit = digits[index]
        for letter in digitToLetters[currentDigit]:
            backtrack(index + 1, currentCombination + letter)

    backtrack(0, "")
    return results
```

## JavaScript Solution

Here is the implementation of the above logic in JavaScript:

```javascript
function letterCombinations(digits) {
  if (digits.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  const digitToLetters = {
    2: "abc",
    3: "def",
    4: "ghi",
    5: "jkl",
    6: "mno",
    7: "pqrs",
    8: "tuv",
    9: "wxyz",
  };

  const results = [];

  function backtrack(index, currentCombination) {
    if (index === digits.length) {
      results.push(currentCombination);
      return;
    }

    const currentDigit = digits[index];
    const letters = digitToLetters[currentDigit];

    for (let i = 0; i < letters.length; i++) {
      backtrack(index + 1, currentCombination + letters[i]);
    }
  }

  backtrack(0, "");
  return results;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(letterCombinations("23"));
```

### Explanation

- The `letterCombinations` function initializes a mapping from digits to letters and an empty array `results` to store the valid combinations.
- The `backtrack` function builds the string `currentCombination` recursively. For each digit, it iterates through its corresponding letters and appends each letter to `currentCombination`, then recursively calls `backtrack` for the next digit.
- When `index` reaches the length of `digits`, it means a valid combination has been formed, so it is added to `results`.
- The process starts with `backtrack` called initially with an empty string and index 0, and `results` is returned after all combinations are generated.
